Low-quality data can be dangerous for the machine learning models, especially in crucial situations. Some large-scale datasets have low-quality data and false labels, also, datasets with images type probably have artifacts and biases from measurement errors. So, automatic algorithms that are able to recognize low-quality data are needed. In this paper, Shapley Value is used, a metric for evaluation of data, to quantify the value of training data to the performance of a classification algorithm in a large ImageNet dataset. We specify the success of data Shapley in recognizing low-quality against precious data for classification. We figure out that model performance is increased when low Shapley values are removed, whilst classification model performance is declined when high Shapley values are removed. Moreover, there were more true labels in high-Shapley value data and more mislabeled samples in low-Shapley value. Results represent that mislabeled or poor-quality images are in low Shapley value and valuable data for classification are in high Shapley value.
